# BeatTogether
A multiplayer private server for the modding community. Supports crossplay between PC and Quest. **This is the Quest Plugin.**

## Features
* Private server free from Beat Saber official; allowing Quest to play freely on modded installs
* Crossplay between all compatible platforms
* Custom songs between platforms

## Installation

To install, Download the latest mod from our releases. [Click Here](https://github.com/pythonology/BeatTogether.Quest/releases)

After downloading, upload the .zip to BMBF on the upload tab of the web interface.

## Custom Song Support
Customs are built-in with this plugin. If you have the matching beatmap with other players inside your lobby prior to a session you can freely play with them with that custom song! In the future, this will definitely change and include a SongLoader. Thus skipping the requirement of needing to download the beatmap prior to the session.

## Special Thanks
