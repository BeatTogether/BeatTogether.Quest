## Features
* Private server free from Beat Saber official; allowing Quest to play freely on modded installs
* Crossplay between all compatible platforms
* Custom songs between platforms

## Installation

## Custom Song Support
Customs are built-in with this plugin. If you have the matching beatmap with other players inside your lobby prior to a session you can freely play with them with that custom song! In the future, this will definitely change and include a SongLoader. Thus skipping the requirement of needing to download the beatmap prior to the session.

## Special Thanks
